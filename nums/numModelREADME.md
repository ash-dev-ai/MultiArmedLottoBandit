# numModel Section

## Overview

The `numModel` section of the project is designed to train and evaluate a variety of machine learning models on lottery datasets. The goal is to predict the likelihood of a particular number being drawn in the next lottery draw based on historical data. This section supports multiple datasets (Powerball, Mega Millions, and a combined dataset) and includes a diverse set of models to ensure robust and accurate predictions.

## Directory Structure

The `numModel` section is organized as follows:

```

## Models Implemented

The following models are implemented and can be trained on Powerball (`pb`), Mega Millions (`mb`), and a combined dataset (`comb`):

1. **GBC (Gradient Boosting Classifier)**
2. **RFC (Random Forest Classifier)**
3. **SVM (Support Vector Machine)**
4. **Logistic Regression**
5. **KNN (K-Nearest Neighbors)**
6. **AdaBoost**
7. **Decision Tree**
8. **Naive Bayes**
9. **SVC (Support Vector Classifier)**
10. **Extra Trees Classifier**
11. **GBR (Gradient Boosting Regressor)**
12. **XGBoost**
13. **LightGBM**
14. **CatBoost**

These models are used to predict whether a given number (from 1 to 69 or 1 to 70 for `Num1-5`, and 1 to 26 or 1 to 25 for `NumA`) will appear in the next draw based on historical data.

## How to Use

### Training the Models

1. **Ensure all dependencies are installed**: 
    - `scikit-learn`
    - `xgboost`
    - `lightgbm`
    - `catboost`
    - `pandas`
    - `joblib`
  
   You can install the required packages using pip:
   ```bash
   pip install scikit-learn xgboost lightgbm catboost pandas joblib
   ```

2. **Run the `numModel_main.py` script**:
   
   This script will automatically train all models on the specified datasets (`pb`, `mb`, and `comb`) and save the trained models in the `models/num/` directory.
   
   ```bash
   python numModel_main.py
   ```

3. **Check the output**:
   - The trained models will be saved in their respective directories under `models/num/`.
   - For example, models trained on the Powerball dataset using Gradient Boosting Classifier will be saved under `models/num/pb/gbc/`.

### Customizing the Configuration

The configuration for each model is managed by the `numModel_config.py` file. This file allows you to:
- Adjust hyperparameters for each model type.
- Specify the range of numbers (`Num1-5` and `NumA`) to be considered.
- Add additional models if needed.

### Extending the Models

To add a new model:
1. Create a new Python script under the `nums/` directory, similar to the existing model scripts.
2. Update the `numModel_main.py` script to include and train the new model.

## Troubleshooting

- **FileNotFoundError**: Ensure that your dataset files (`data_pb.csv`, `data_mb.csv`, `data_comb.csv`) are in the correct directory specified in the scripts.
- **ImportErrors**: Make sure all dependencies are installed and that the Python paths are correctly set.
