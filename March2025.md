# Quantum-Inspired Observational–Expected Distribution Algorithm

This document presents a professional, formal description of a quantum-inspired algorithm for managing and predicting outcomes with separate “observed” and “expected” amplitude distributions. The method is designed to capture and adapt to loose or cyclical patterns in a (near-)random process, especially one separated into two categories (`pb` and `mb`) that occur on different days of the week.

## 1. Overview

- **Major Sets**  
  - **`pb`**: Occurs on Monday, Wednesday, and Saturday.  
    - State space \(\Omega_{pb}\) consists of combinations (5 from 1–69, 1 from 1–26).  
  - **`mb`**: Occurs on Tuesday and Friday.  
    - State space \(\Omega_{mb}\) consists of combinations (5 from 1–70, 1 from 1–25).

- **Amplitude Distributions**  
  Each major set has two separate amplitude distributions:
  1. **Observed Distribution** \(\alpha^\text{(obs)}\) – tracks empirical data in near-real time.  
  2. **Expected Distribution** \(\alpha^\text{(exp)}\) – represents a stable forecast or model of future outcomes.

## 2. State Spaces

1. **Define \(\Omega_{pb}\)**  
   \[
   \Omega_{pb} = 
   \bigl\{
     s \mid s \text{ is a 6-value outcome for pb}
   \bigr\}, 
   \quad
   \vert\Omega_{pb}\vert = \binom{69}{5} \times 26.
   \]

2. **Define \(\Omega_{mb}\)**  
   \[
   \Omega_{mb} = 
   \bigl\{
     s \mid s \text{ is a 6-value outcome for mb}
   \bigr\}, 
   \quad
   \vert\Omega_{mb}\vert = \binom{70}{5} \times 25.
   \]

3. **Initialize Distributions**  
   For each set \(\Omega_{pb}\) and \(\Omega_{mb}\), initialize two vectors of amplitudes:
   \[
   \alpha_s^\text{(obs)} \quad\text{and}\quad \alpha_s^\text{(exp)},
   \]
   where \(s \in \Omega_{pb}\) or \(s \in \Omega_{mb}\). Each vector is normalized so that
   \[
   \sum_{s \in \Omega_{pb}} |\alpha_s^\text{(obs)}|^2 = 1, 
   \quad
   \sum_{s \in \Omega_{pb}} |\alpha_s^\text{(exp)}|^2 = 1,
   \]
   and similarly for \(\Omega_{mb}\).

## 3. Observational Updates

### 3.1 Observed Distribution Update

#### Purpose
Reflects the direct frequency of outcomes in the data, potentially with a smoothing or decay factor to emphasize recent observations.

#### Example Rule
When a new outcome \(s_\text{obs}\) in \(\Omega_{pb}\) or \(\Omega_{mb}\) is recorded, update the corresponding observed distribution as follows:

1. Apply an exponential decay to all amplitudes:
   \[
   \alpha_s^\text{(obs)} \leftarrow \gamma \cdot \alpha_s^\text{(obs)},
   \]
   for each \(s \in \Omega\), where \(\gamma \in [0,1)\) is a decay parameter.

2. Boost the observed amplitude for the actually drawn state:
   \[
   \alpha_{s_\text{obs}}^\text{(obs)} \leftarrow \alpha_{s_\text{obs}}^\text{(obs)} + (1 - \gamma).
   \]

3. Normalize to ensure:
   \[
   \sum_{s \in \Omega} |\alpha_s^\text{(obs)}|^2 = 1.
   \]

### 3.2 Expected Distribution Update

#### Purpose
Maintains a stable prediction model that does not overreact to individual observations.

#### Example Rule
After updating the observed distribution, adjust the expected distribution with a small learning rate \(\eta\):

\[
\alpha_s^\text{(exp)} \;\leftarrow\;
\alpha_s^\text{(exp)} + \eta \Bigl(\,\alpha_s^\text{(obs)} - \alpha_s^\text{(exp)}\Bigr).
\]

Then normalize:
\[
\sum_{s \in \Omega} \bigl|\alpha_s^\text{(exp)}\bigr|^2 = 1.
\]

## 4. Daily Procedure

The following procedure outlines how the algorithm is executed each day of the week, respecting the schedules for `pb` and `mb`:

Algorithm QuantumInspiredObservationalExpectedModel:

1. For each day D in the repeating weekly cycle:
   2. If D is one of {Monday, Wednesday, Saturday}:
      2.1. Obtain the real-world outcome s_obs in Ω_pb.
      2.2. Update Observed Distribution α^(obs, pb):
          a. Apply exponential decay: α_s^(obs, pb) ← γ * α_s^(obs, pb).
          b. Increment α_(s_obs)^(obs, pb) by (1 - γ).
          c. Normalize α^(obs, pb).

      2.3. Update Expected Distribution α^(exp, pb):
          a. For each s ∈ Ω_pb:
             α_s^(exp, pb) ← α_s^(exp, pb) + η * (α_s^(obs, pb) - α_s^(exp, pb)).
          b. Normalize α^(exp, pb).

   3. Else if D is one of {Tuesday, Friday}:
      3.1. Obtain the real-world outcome s_obs in Ω_mb.
      3.2. Update Observed Distribution α^(obs, mb):
          a. Apply exponential decay: α_s^(obs, mb) ← γ * α_s^(obs, mb).
          b. Increment α_(s_obs)^(obs, mb) by (1 - γ).
          c. Normalize α^(obs, mb).

      3.3. Update Expected Distribution α^(exp, mb):
          a. For each s ∈ Ω_mb:
             α_s^(exp, mb) ← α_s^(exp, mb) + η * (α_s^(obs, mb) - α_s^(exp, mb)).
          b. Normalize α^(exp, mb).

## 5. Optional Quantum Interference Extension

In a strictly real-valued approach, amplitudes \(\alpha_s\) are non-negative. A quantum-inspired algorithm can allow **complex amplitudes** with phases, enabling interference effects:

1. **Complex Representation**:  
   \[
   \alpha_s = r_s \, e^{i\,\theta_s},
   \]
   where \(r_s \ge 0\) and \(\theta_s \in [0,2\pi)\).

2. **Phase Updates**:  
   Observed outcomes or suspected cyclical patterns can trigger phase shifts. For instance:
   \[
   \theta_s \;\leftarrow\; \theta_s + \Delta\theta \quad \text{(constructive shift if }s \text{ aligns with observation)},
   \]
   or
   \[
   \theta_s \;\leftarrow\; \theta_s - \Delta\theta \quad \text{(destructive shift if }s \text{ conflicts with observation)}.
   \]
   Magnitudes are also updated to reflect empirical frequency. This method can highlight or suppress overlapping patterns via interference.

3. **Normalization**:
   \[
   \sum_{s} |\,\alpha_s\,|^2 = 1
   \]
   remains a strict requirement after each update step.

## 6. Use Cases and Benefits

- **Adaptive Forecasting**: The expected distribution adjusts gently over time, guided by the observed distribution, which tracks new data more directly.  
- **Noise vs. Pattern Detection**: Persistent increases in observed amplitude for certain outcomes indicate recurring patterns, while sporadic occurrences fade due to exponential decay.  
- **Quantum-Inspired Explorations**: Introducing phases allows the system to represent and potentially amplify loose or cyclic patterns that might not be captured well by purely real-valued probability models.

## 7. Conclusion

The described **Quantum-Inspired Observational–Expected Distribution Algorithm** maintains two amplitude distributions for each major set (`pb` or `mb`), reflecting both empirical outcomes and stable predictive expectations. The daily update cycle ensures alignment with real-world data while avoiding overfitting to single observations. Extensions with complex phases permit interference, a core quantum phenomenon that can further expose or harness subtle recurring structures in near-random processes.
